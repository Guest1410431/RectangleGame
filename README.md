# Rectangle Game

A project I have started too many times and finished far too few. Coded in collaboration with other programmers as a learning experience for graphics, teamwork, and project planning. 

### The Final Product
The game is inspired by [this post](https://imgur.com/gallery/ybMoPPb). It will eventually be networked and able to handle a dynamic number of players. AI is considered.

### TODO:
Window setup
  - ~~Window and subsequent panels~~
  - Linking between views, models, and controllers

Game logic
  - Game States (roll, place rectangle, wait for other player, etc)
  - Legal move detection
  - Game over detection
  - Win/Lose/Draw detection

Neworking
  - Server->Client capabilities

????

Profit?
